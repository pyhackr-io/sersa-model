## This is a copy of a project developed with 4 other people as part of my Le-wagon Data scicene bootcamp. The original code can be found
## at https://github.com/Iases22/ser_app. It used google for the docker image. I am looking to port this to AWS  and use sagemaker.

```bash
export PROJECT_ID=<name of GCP Project Id>
export DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME=<Name>
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<gcp creditonals file>
```
# Startup the project

The initial setup.

Create virtualenv and install the project:
```bash
sudo apt-get install virtualenv python-pip python-dev
deactivate; virtualenv ~/venv ; source ~/venv/bin/activate ;\
    pip install pip -U; pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Unittest test:
```bash
make clean install test
```

Check for ser in gitlab.com/{group}.
If your project is not set please add it:

- Create a new project on `gitlab.com/{group}/ser`
- Then populate it:

```bash
##   e.g. if group is "{group}" and project_name is "ser"
git remote add origin git@github.com:{group}/ser.git
git push -u origin master
git push -u origin --tags
```

Functionnal test with a script:

```bash
cd
mkdir tmp
cd tmp
ser-run
```

# Install

setup you ssh public key, ...

Create a python3 virtualenv and activate it:

```

Clone the project and install it:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:{group}/ser.git
cd ser
pip install -r requirements.txt
make clean install test                # install and test
```
Functionnal test with a script:

```bash
cd
mkdir tmp
